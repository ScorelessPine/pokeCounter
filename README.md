# pokeCounter
Code of the website http://poke-shinycounter.com

#1 - Concept
The objective is to create a tool for Shiny Hunters.

The main objective is to use the law of large numbers to get the most precise odds to get shiny by catching method or version.


#2 - Code
The app is made with Angular.js
The actual code (03/08/15) is the prototype one. Feel free to edit it.
At the moment all the datas are saved on the client computer. It would be nice to save it with Firebase.

#3 - Files
pokemon.js : JSON with the National ID and the name of each Pokemon.
img        : image of each Pokemon.
css-img    : images use by the CSS

Main code forked from pokeCounter and edited slightly
